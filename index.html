        &ldquo;One should not treat others in ways that one would not like to be treated&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a maxim from BC times (around 1800BC if I recall) and I don&rsquo;t like it very much. It&rsquo;s even in the bible, in Leviticus; &ldquo;Love thy neighbour as thyself&rdquo; as a more positive spin on the old maxim. I &ldquo;get&rdquo; it. It&rsquo;s platitudinal basis is okay in that it&rsquo;s the absolute minimum a person should base their morals on but it bothers me.

        It was my first day at primary school, I was excited and giddy. Nursery always bored me. I was always more interested in literature; both reading and writing, I wrote my first book at 6, was a 12 page extravaganza about a sad crocodile that had lost it&rsquo;s teeth and I was frequently stood in front of my class showing my fellow students how to craft boats, rocket ships and other exciting things from cereal boxes, used up toilet rolls and other homely/thrifty crafting materials.

        A few months ago I gave a talk at Async about similarities between NodeJS and Golang, they&rsquo;ve kindly uploaded the video 7 Similarities Between Go and Node - 2015-05-21 from Async on Vimeo.
